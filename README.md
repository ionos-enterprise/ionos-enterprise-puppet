## Description

The ProfitBricks Puppet module allows a multi-server cloud environment using ProfitBricks resources to be deployed automatically from a Puppet manifest file.

This module utilizes the ProfitBricks [Cloud API](https://devops.profitbricks.com/api/cloud/) via the [ProfitBricks Ruby SDK](https://devops.profitbricks.com/libraries/ruby/) to manage resources within a virtual data center. A Puppet manifest file can be used to describe the desired infrastructure configuration including networks, servers, CPU cores, memory, and their relationships as well as states. That infrastructure can then be easily and automatically deployed using Puppet.

## Getting Started

Before you begin you will need to have [signed-up for a ProfitBricks account](https://devops.profitbricks.com/signup). The credentials you establish during sign-up will be used to authenticate against the ProfitBricks Cloud API.

### Requirements

* Puppet 4.2.x or greater
* Ruby 2.0 or greater
* ProfitBricks Ruby SDK (profitbricks-sdk-ruby)
* ProfitBricks account

## Installation

There are multiple ways that Puppet and Ruby can be installed on an operating system (OS).

For users who already have a system with Puppet and Ruby installed, the following three easy steps should get the ProfitBricks Puppet module working. **Note:** You may need to prefix `sudo` to the commands in steps one and two.

1. Install the ProfitBricks Ruby SDK using `gem`.

        gem install profitbricks-sdk-ruby

2. Install the module.

        puppet module install profitbricks-profitbricks

3. Set the environment variables for authentication.

        export PROFITBRICKS_USERNAME="user@example.com"
        export PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD="secretpassword"

    Setting the ProfitBricks API URL is optional.

        export PROFITBRICKS_API_URL="https://api.profitbricks.com/cloudapi/v3"

A situation could arise in which you have installed a Puppet release that contains a bundled copy of Ruby, but you already had Ruby installed. In that case, you will want to be sure to specify the `gem` binary that comes with the bundled version of Ruby. This avoids a situation in which you inadvertently install the *profitbricks-ruby-sdk* library but it is not available to the Ruby install that Puppet is actually using.

To demonstrate this on a CentOS 7 server, these steps could be followed.

**Note:** You may need to prefix `sudo` to the commands in steps one through three.

1. Install Puppet using the official Puppet Collection.

        rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm

        yum install puppet-agent

2. Install the ProfitBricks Ruby SDK using `gem`. **Note:** We are supplying the full path to the `gem` binary.

        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install profitbricks-sdk-ruby

3. Install the Puppet module. **Note:** We are supplying the full path to the `puppet` binary.

        /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet module install profitbricks-profitbricks

4. Set the environment variables for authentication.

        export PROFITBRICKS_USERNAME="user@example.com"
        export PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD="secretpassword"

## Usage

A Puppet manifest uses a domain specific language, or DSL. This language allows resources and their states to be declared. Puppet will then build the resources and set the states as described in the manifest. The following snippet describes a simple LAN resource.

    lan { 'public':
      ensure => present,
      public => true,
      datacenter_id => '2dbf0e6b-3430-46fd-befd-6d08acd96557'
    }

A LAN named `public` will have public Internet access enabled and will reside in the defined virtual data center.

**Note**: It is important that resource names be unique within the manifest. This includes both similar and different resource types. For example, a LAN resource named `public` will conflict with a server resource named `public`.

To provide a data center ID, you can create a data center within the module as follows:

    datacenter { 'myDataCenter' :
      ensure      => present,
      location    => 'de/fra',
      description => 'test data center'
    }

Afterwards, get the data center ID using the puppet resource command:

    puppet resource datacenter [myDataCenter]

which should return output similar to this:

    datacenter { 'myDataCenter':
      ensure      => 'present',
      description => 'test data center',
      id          => '4af72f13-221d-499d-88ea-48713173e12f',
      location    => 'de/fra',
    }

The returned *id* value of *4af72f13-221d-499d-88ea-48713173e12f* may be used elsewhere in our manifest to identify this virtual data center.

A data center name can be used instead. You may find this more convenient than using a data center ID. Please refer to the next section for an example.

If you have already created your data center, LAN and server resources, you may connect them with a new NIC resource using their names or IDs.

    $datacenter_name = 'testdc1'
    $server_name = 'worker1'
    $lan_name = 'public1'

    nic { 'testnic':
      datacenter_name   => $datacenter_name,
      server_name => $server_name,
      nat => false,
      dhcp => true,
      lan => $lan_name,
      ips => ['78.137.103.102', '78.137.103.103', '78.137.103.104'],
      firewall_active => true,
      firewall_rules => [
        {
          name => 'SSH',
          protocol => 'TCP',
          port_range_start => 22,
          port_range_end => 22
        }
      ]
    }

**Note**: Using the ProfitBricks Puppet module to manage your ProfitBricks resources ensures uniqueness of the managed instances. The ProfitBricks Cloud API allows the creation of multiple virtual data centers having the same name.

If you attempt to manage LAN and server resources using data center names, the module will throw an error when more than one virtual data center with the same name is detected. The same is true if you attempt to remove virtual data centers by non-unique names.

### Verification

Once you have composed a manifest, it is good to have Puppet validate the syntax. The Puppet accessory `parser` can check for syntax errors. To validate a manifest named `init.pp` run:

    puppet parser validate init.pp

If the manifest validates successfully, no output is returned. If there is an issue, you should get some output indicating what is invalid:

    Error: Could not parse for environment production: Syntax error at '}' at init.pp:8:2

That error message indicates we should take a look at a curly brace located on line 8 column 2 of `init.pp`.

To have puppet go ahead and apply the manifest run:

    puppet apply init.pp

## Examples

## Full Server Example

The following example will describe deploying a new server with public Internet access and allow inbound SSH connections.

**Note:** the value for `$datacenter_id` needs to be set to a valid virtual data center UUID that your account credentials are allowed to access. There are a couple of ways to get the UUID of a virtual data center. You can make a GET request against the Cloud API using a command-line tool such as `curl`, use an application such Postman, or one of various browser plugins for working with REST APIs.

The [ProfitBricks CLI](https://devops.profitbricks.com/tools/cli/) may be helpful as the command: `profitbricks datacenter list` will return a list of available virtual data centers.

It is also possible to get the UUID from inside the ProfitBricks Data Center Designer (DCD). If you log in and hover over one of your virtual data centers listed under "My Data Centers", a tooltip appears that contains the UUID.

Once we have a valid virtual data center UUID, lets proceed with the full server example.

    $datacenter_id = '2dbf0e6b-3430-46fd-befd-6d08acd96557'

    lan { 'publicLAN':
      ensure => present,
      public => true,
      datacenter_id => $datacenter_id
    }

    server { 'frontend':
      ensure => running,
      datacenter_id => $datacenter_id,
      cores => 2,
      cpu_family => 'INTEL_XEON',
      ram => 4096,
      volumes => [
        {
          name => 'system',
          size => 5,
          bus => 'VIRTIO',
          volume_type => 'SSD',
          image_id => 'e87692f2-3587-11e5-9b0d-52540066fee9',
          image_password => 'mysecretpassword',
          availability_zone => 'AUTO'
        }
      ],
      nics => [
        {
          name => 'nic0',
          dhcp => true,
          lan => 'publicLAN',
          nat => false,
          firewall_rules => [
            {
              name => 'SSH',
              protocol => 'TCP',
              port_range_start => 22,
              port_range_end => 22
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

Instead of providing a data center ID, you can create a data center along with LAN and server resources in a single manifest by using the data center name as the input parameter.

    $datacenter_name = 'MyDataCenter'

    datacenter { $datacenter_name :
      ensure      => present,
      location    => 'de/fkb',
      description => 'my data center desc.'
    } ->

    lan { 'publicLAN' :
      ensure => present,
      public => true,
      datacenter_name => $datacenter_name
    } ->

    server { 'worker1' :
      ensure => present,
      cores => 2,
      datacenter_name => $datacenter_name,
      ram => 1024,
      volumes => [
        {
          name => 'system',
          size => 50,
          bus => 'VIRTIO',
          volume_type => 'SSD',
          image_id => '7412cec6-e83c-11e6-a994-525400f64d8d',
          ssh_keys => [ 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA...' ],
          availability_zone => 'AUTO'
        }
      ],
      nics => [
        {
          name => 'publicNIC',
          dhcp => true,
          lan => 'publicLAN',
          nat => false,
          firewall_rules => [
            {
              name => 'SSH',
              protocol => 'TCP',
              port_range_start => 22,
              port_range_end => 22
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

## Remove Resources

The following example sets the above resource states to `absent`. This will cause the server named `frontend` along with the associated `public` LAN to be removed.

    $datacenter_id = '2dbf0e6b-3430-46fd-befd-6d08acd96557'

    server { 'frontend':
      ensure => absent,
      datacenter_id => $datacenter_id
    } ~>
    lan { 'public':
      ensure => absent,
      datacenter_id => $datacenter_id
    }

By default, the volumes attached to the server resources will remain available when the server is removed. If you prefer to have the volumes removed along with the server, then the `purge_volumes` property will need to be set to `true` for the server resource:

    server { 'frontend' :
      ensure => absent,
      purge_volumes => true,
      datacenter_id => '2dbf0e6b-3430-46fd-befd-6d08acd96557'
    }

**Note:** Volume removal is permanent. Be sure to perform a snapshot if you wish to retain the volume data.

**Note:** You may use `datacenter_name` instead of `datacenter_id` when removing LANs and servers.

**Notes:**

* The volume `size` can be increased after the volume is created.
* When managing a volume independently, either the `datacenter_id` or `datacenter_name` is required.
* Either `image_id` or `licence_type` **must** be defined.
* When using a ProfitBricks provided public `image_id` either `image_password` or `ssh_keys` **must** be set. You **may** set both if you wish.

If the volume is **NOT** nested under a server resource, then one of the following parameters is required.

**Notes on NAT**:

* The NIC this is being activated on **must** belong to a private LAN.
* The NIC **must not** belong to a load balancer.
* NAT **cannot** be activated in a private LAN that contains an IPv4 address ending with ".1".
* NAT **should not** be enabled in a virtual data center with an active ProfitBricks firewall.

**Note**: `ips`, `dhcp`, `lan` and `nat` are mutable properties.

If the NIC is **NOT** nested under a server resource, some of the following parameters are required as well.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- | --- |

| firewall_active | no | boolean | `true` indicates the firewall is active. Default value is `false`. |

### Firewall Rule Resource

Firewall rules are usually nested within `nics` under the server resource. This section applies to the ProfitBricks firewall for a virtual data center that you can also configure through the DCD or via the Cloud API. It does **NOT** refer to a firewall that is part of the OS or running as service on the virtual machine.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- | --- |
| name | **yes** | string | The name of the firewall rule. |
| protocol | **yes** | string | Allow traffic protocols including `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, and `ANY`. |
| source_mac | no | string | Allow traffic from the source MAC address. |
| source_ip | no | string | Allow traffic originating from the source IP address. |
| target_ip | no | string | Allow traffic destined to the target IP address. |
| port_range_start | no | string | Defines the start range of the allowed port (from 1 to 65534) if protocol TCP or UDP is chosen. |
| port_range_end | no | string | Defines the end range of the allowed port (from 1 to 65534) if the protocol TCP or UDP is chosen. |
| icmp_type | no | string | Defines the allowed type (from 0 to 254) if the protocol ICMP is chosen. |
| icmp_code | no | string | Defines the allowed code (from 0 to 254) if protocol ICMP is chosen. |

**Note**: `source_mac`, `source_ip`, `target_ip`, `port_range_start`, `port_range_end`, `icmp_type` and `icmp_code` are mutable properties.

If firewall rules are managed as an independent resource, the associated virtual data center, server, and NIC must be specified.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- | --- |
| datacenter_id | **yes** | string | The UUID of an existing virtual data center where the firewall rule is or will be created. Optional, if `datacenter_name` is specified. |
| datacenter_name | **yes** | string | The name of the virtual data center where the firewall rule is or will be created. Optional, if `datacenter_id` is specified. |
| server_id  | **yes** | string | The UUID of an existing server where the firewall rule will reside. Optional, if `server_name` is specified. |
| server_name | **yes** | string | The name of the server where the firewall rule will reside. Optional, if `server_id` is specified. |
| nic | **yes** | string | The name of the NIC the firewall rule will be added to. |

## Testing

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your development enviroment with `bundle`. Then use `rake` to run all the available tests.

You can accomplish this by running the following commands from inside the repository root.

    bundle install
    rake spec

A successful test run should return output similar to:

    ............................................................

    Finished in 28.12 seconds (files took 2.59 seconds to load)
    60 examples, 0 failures

You can bypass `rake` and run a single test using `rspec` and supplying a path to the specific test. To do this for the *datacenter* test:

    rspec spec/unit/provider/datacenter/v1_spec.rb

    ..

    Finished in 0.06585 seconds (files took 2.28 seconds to load)
    2 examples, 0 failures
